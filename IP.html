                    <P>It was the birth of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and also the IP (Internet Protocol).
                        The inventor for the TCP and IP were Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn.
                        The TCP and IP is part of the groundwork for the modern-day internet.
                        TCP is known for the reliability of data delivery through communication.
                        IP is known for providing the route and addressing for data to be sent through different available networks.
