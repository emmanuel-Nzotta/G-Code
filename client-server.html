            Client-side engineering is referred to as front – end development. It involves creating a user interface and experience of the web application. Users have a direct interaction with this part of web development. The design, layout and interactivity is all part of the presentation layer that users interface with. The most common technologies are used in client – side engineering:

                <p>
                    Server – Side Engineering is referred to as back - end development. This type of engineering include the create and functionality together to power a web application. Server – Side Engineering is most commonly used for data processing and business logic operations. This server is designed to be reliable for the managing of data and handling requests from the users.

                <p>
                    Server-Side programming language: One of the most used languages for this programming language would properly be Python of Java. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Before just choosing a language it would be wise to do research for what the user’s requirements are and then the right language with that requirements will be suited for the user. Let’s go through the most common used languages:

                <p>
                    Application Programming Interfaces (API): Between the Client-side engineering and the Server-side engineering there is a middle code called Application Programming Interfaces. It allows communication between the client and server side of engineering. The API is used for defining how the different software components interact with each other. The client side of engineering will request data or preforms actions to take place on the server-side engineering.
